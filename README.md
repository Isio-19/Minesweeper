# Minesweeper 
### By Jérôme CHEN (@Isio19)

A basic minesweeper implementation made in Python. Playable through the console or a GUI, made in TKinter.

To run the game, either double click the minesweeper.exe file to run it with the GUI, or run it in-console with argument 'cli' or 'gui' depending on the version you want to run.

If you want to recompile the exe file, you can find the command in the compileAsExe.txt file. You can find your compiled exe in the dist folder.
